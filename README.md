## Project Management Methodology:

<br/>

During the development of 'SubTracked', the project was managed with the Kanban style. 
- After initial user requirements were identified, the application was split into two sections, back-end and front-end
- These applications were created separately and tasks were created in Trello, being designated to one of 4 states:
    - Backlog: For all tasks that were ideated during the brainstorming stage of development
    - In Progress: For all tasks currently being worked on
    - Testing: For completed tasks that were ready to be reviewed by another member of the team
    - Complete: For tasks that have been built and marked by the team as a working, successfully completed feature or application milestone

## User Stories:

<br/>

***As a user, I want to:***

- be able to keep track of my paid subscriptions in order to budget and keep on top of my finances
    - This speaks to the overall functionality of the application and has not ultimately changed since the idea was selected for the project.

- be able to create and edit my own subscriptions, including the billing frequency and amount
    - Initially, this requirement was just for the creation and editing of a subscription with the amount, but it seemed more useful to allow users to choose the billing frequency for each subscription as each will have a different billing cycle. Including this frequency allows users to see in their dashboard a countdown to the due date for every subscription, providing the application significantly more utility.

- be able to delete subscriptions after I've unsubscribed from them
    - This was an early requirement that has not changed since inception.

- be alerted when a subscription is due and how much it will cost
    - Notifications were initially omitted due to project time frame constraints, but were ultimately included as they will make up a large part of the success of the application, as a subscription management platform that doesn't notify users of upcoming payments is unlikely to be very useful.

- be able to navigate the application easily via a simple and intuitive interface
    - An easy-to-use interface was a key requirement from the initial planning phase for the application.
